## Games

### 1. Bouncing Ball Animation

- Simple physics simulation with a ball bouncing around the screen
- Tests: Basic rendering, animation system, collision detection with screen boundaries
- Great for showcasing smooth movement and your animation framework

Gradually add features like:

- Multiple balls with different properties
- Color changes on collision
- Particle trails
- Sound effects
- Interactive elements (mouse interaction)

### 2. Simple Snake Game

- Classic snake that grows when eating food
- Tests: Input handling, game state management, collision detection, score tracking
- Uses basic sprites and grid-based movement

### 3. Asteroid Field

- Player spaceship navigating through floating asteroids
- Tests: Sprite rotation, collision detection, particle effects, input responsiveness
- Can showcase smooth movement and rotation animations

### 4. Simple Platformer

- Basic character jumping on platforms
- Tests: Gravity simulation, collision detection, sprite animation, level management
- Great for testing scene management with different levels

### 5. Pong Clone

- Two paddles hitting a ball back and forth
- Tests: Input handling, collision detection, score system, AI for single player
- Classic and easy to implement
