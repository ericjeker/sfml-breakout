# TODO

## Managers

- [x] ServiceLocator
- [x] SceneManager
- [x] EventSystem
- [x] AudioManager
- [ ] CameraManager, CameraSystem, Scrolling, Culling (?)
- [ ] Reusable ObjectPool
- [x] CommandRegistry, CommandSystem, Controllers
  - Right now there is no abstraction between the SFML events and the action, so we cannot map
    them to different keys or actions. There is no notion of AIController or NetworkController either.
- [x] UIManager, GraphScene, SceneNode (this is handled by Flecs)

## Features

- [ ] SpatialPartitioning (grid)
- [ ] Load scenes, entities, components, systems from serialized files
- [x] CollisionSystem with collision shape (circle, rectangle)
  - [ ] Add other types of Collider
- [x] SpriteRenderer
  - [ ] TileMap
  - [ ] SpriteAnimation
- [x] ControllerSystem (PlayerController, AIController, NetworkController)
  - [ ] Behaviors (State Machine, Behavior Tree)
  - [ ] Possession
- [ ] AnimationSystem, SpriteAnimations
- [x] ParticleSystem
- [ ] ShaderEffects

## Bugs / Improvements

- [x] ScreenBouncing doesn't account for drawable size
- [x] Integrate Tracy for profiling
- [x] MainMenuState contains everything, it should be a game selector with an FSM
- [x] Use namespaces to encapsulate modules?
- [ ] I should not use `auto` everywhere, especially not when type clarity is important

## Clean Code

- [x] Remove magic numbers in BouncingBallScene (radius, gravity, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling can certainly be improved everywhere
- [ ] Clarify and Refactor the include statements

## General Optimizations

### 1. Rendering Optimizations

- [ ] Batch rendering: Instead of drawing each entity individually, use `sf::VertexArray` or `sf::VertexBuffer` to draw multiple entities in a single draw call
- [ ] Frustum Culling: Only render what is visible on screen
- [ ] Sprite batching: Use texture atlases and batch similar sprites together

### 2. Resourcement Management

- [ ] Right now the assets have to be unique across all bundles, ideally they should be accessible using BundleName::AssetName

### 2. Physics Optimizations

- [ ] Spatial partitioning: Use a spatial hash grid, quadtree, or broad-phase collision detection
- [ ] Object pooling: Reuse entity objects instead of creating/destroying them

### 3. Flecs Optimizations

- [ ] ~~Create modules instead of individual scenes, each scene can be a module~~
- [x] Have a single world handling everything so that the game state can be stored in it too

### 4. SFML-Specific Optimizations

- [ ] Reduce state changes: Minimize texture binding and shader changes
- [ ] Use sf::Transform: Cache transformation matrices instead of recalculating them
- [ ] ~~Profile with sf::Clock: Measure actual frame times to identify bottlenecks~~

### 5. General C++ Optimizations

- [ ] Avoid dynamic allocation: Use object pools and stack allocation where possible
- [x] Profile-guided optimization: Use profilers to identify hotspots
- [ ] Compiler flags: Use `-O3` and appropriate optimization flags

### 6. Polish

- ðŸŽ¨ **Art & Animation** sprites, textures, smooth animations
- ðŸŽµ **Audio Integration** music, sound effects, audio mixing
- ðŸŽ® **Game Design** balanced gameplay, progression, user experience
- âœ¨ **Polish** particles effects, screen transitions, juice
- ðŸ“± **UI/UX Design** menus, HUD, responsive interface

## Games

### 1. Bouncing Ball Animation
